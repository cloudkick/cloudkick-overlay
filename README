Installation
============

1. Preparing Layman

The easiest way to install this overlay is to use layman. To use this overlay
with layman you will need to install layman with the "git" USE flag:

    echo "app-portage/layman git" >> /etc/portage/package.use
    emerge --sync
    emerge -a layman

You will also need to modify /etc/make.conf to use layman, but you should hold
off until you've added an overlay, otherwise emerge gets unhappy.


2. Adding the Cloudkick Overlay

Open up /etc/layman/layman.cfg and look for a line that says 'overlays  :'. Add
'http://github.com/cloudkick/cloudkick-overlay/raw/master/overlay.xml' so that
it looks something like this:

overlays  : http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/repositories.xml
            http://github.com/cloudkick/cloudkick-overlay/raw/master/overlay.xml

You you can add the Cloudkick Overlay by running

    layman -L
    layman -a cloudkick-overlay

At this point you will need to edit your /etc/make.conf by adding
'source /var/lib/layman/make.conf' at the end.

3. Installing the Cloudkick Agent

You should now be able to install the Cloudkick Agent by running

    emerge -a cloudkick-agent

This will also pull in the cloudkick-config tool which helsp you configure the
agent. When they are done installing run.

    cloudkick-config

And provide your Cloudkick username and password when prompted. This will
generate a basic /etc/cloudkick.conf. If this node already appears on your
Cloudkick dashboard then this is all the configuration needed. Otherwise you
will need to specify a node name in /etc/cloudkick.conf as described at
https://support.cloudkick.com/Agent/Cloudkick.conf.

You probably also want to add the agent to the default runlevel:

    rc-update add cloudkick-agent default

Now start the agent

    /etc/init.d/cloudkick-agent start

And log into Cloudkick and make sure the agent is shown as connected in the
Dashboard. If not, check /var/log/cloudkick-agent.log for troubleshooting
information.

Updating the Agent
==================

1. Syncing Layman

First you'll need to update your local copy of the cloudkick overlay:

    layman -s cloudkick-overlay

If you want to always keep your agent up to date, the best approach is to do
this on a cron job - weekly is probably fine.

2. Updating the Agent

    emerge -a cloudkick-agent
